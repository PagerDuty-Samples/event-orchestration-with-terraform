# PagerDuty Event Orchestration with Terraform
This is a sample of how to define PagerDuty Event Orchestration objects using Terraform. The goal is to allow you to copy this code and run it on a [PagerDuty Developer Account](https://developer.pagerduty.com/sign-up/) so you can experiment with it yourself. 

*NOTE:* This sample uses Priorities, which is a feature that needs to be activated on your PagerDuty account before running this code. To activate Prioritization, go to your PagerDuty Account Settings > Incident Prioritization. Then click the Enable Incident Prioritization button. 

Please post issues on this project if you have any questions. Thanks!
